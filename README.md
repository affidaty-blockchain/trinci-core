# Trinci Blockchain was conceived and has evolved in the enterprise world. 

It has been planned in order to favour the value exchanges between individuals, companies, robots, IoT, AI, financial and banking systems in a secure, distributed and decentralized way

## Vision
The technical and application philosophy that is behind the blockchain technology has demonstrated its resilience in the most hostile contexts of the computer science. However it seems not suitable for the enterprise world, because not so easily it adapts to the real economy particularly to the normative contexts in which the companies are involved.
 
It has to be created a new technology, that saves the resilience of the blockchain technology, favour the interactions, the certifications and the exchanges between private and legal subjects. It has to admit the transit of datas that represent the values of real life, such as the FIAT currency, the property rights and all the assets that build a digital ecosystem. There are also included all the rules with which these values are managed and exchanged.
 
Trinci presents itself as the base technology that can develop a more efficient and safer way to interchange values through transactions. Such transactions can be signed digitally by individual actors ( humans, IoT devices, robots,Ai Network, ecc..) or voted as in the case of multiple subjects ( members of groups who decide internally according to established rules, but act externally of the group as if they were a single and compact subject)

### The technology is based on 4 principal pillars:
* A decentralized, distributed blockchain technology with different consensus algorithms depending on business and network needs
* A sovereign digital identity system that identifies every user and that can be compliant with the normative standards. Moreover it can be dynamically enriched with authoritative and recognized certificates
* A natively integrated Exchange with a technology that works as a bridge between the blockchain world and the real economy, allowing at the same time the exchanges in a deterministic way along the lines of the legal and normative aspects that manage the interchange between tokens and FIAT currency
* A system of blockâ€™s anchoring on a network of public notarization that guarantees the immutability of datas without interfering
